## Write a short comment describing this function
# makeCacheMatrix function creates a cache matrix object that allows storing and retrieving a matrix, 
# as well as caching its inverse for efficient computations.

# Arguments:
# - x: Optional argument for initializing the matrix. Defaults to an empty matrix if not provided.

# Returns:
# - A list containing the following methods:
#   - set: Sets the value of the matrix. Takes a matrix as an argument.
#   - get: Retrieves the stored matrix.
#   - setinverse: Sets the value of the inverse of the matrix. Takes an inverse matrix as an argument.
#   - getinverse: Retrieves the stored inverse matrix.

# Note: The matrix and inverse are stored as variables in a closure (using <<- operator) to maintain their
# values between function calls, allowing for caching and efficient retrieval.


makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    i <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
          x <<- y
          i <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinverse <- function(inverse) i <<- inverse
  getinverse <- function() i
  list(set = set,
       get = get,
       setinverse = setinverse,
       getinverse = getinverse)
}

# cacheSolve function calculates the inverse of a matrix, utilizing caching for efficient computation.

# Arguments:
# - x: The cache matrix object obtained from makeCacheMatrix().
# - ...: Additional arguments to be passed to the solve() function.

# Returns:
# - The inverse of the matrix.

# Function Flow:
# 1. Check if the inverse of the matrix is already cached in the cache matrix object.
# 2. If the inverse is found, retrieve and return it, displaying a message indicating cached data was used.
# 3. If the inverse is not cached, retrieve the matrix from the cache matrix object.
# 4. Calculate the inverse of the matrix using the solve() function, passing any additional arguments.
# 5. Store the computed inverse in the cache matrix object for future use.
# 6. Return the computed inverse.

# Note: The cache matrix object is accessed using its methods, such as x$getinverse() and x$get(),
# to retrieve the inverse and the matrix, respectively. The inverse is stored and retrieved from
# the cache matrix object using these methods to improve computation efficiency.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  i <- x$getinverse()
  if (!is.null(i)) {
          message("getting cached data")
          return(i)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  i <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setinverse(i)
  i
}
